    Today I focused on the target of what we must deliver to the backend: a tree.
    It might be wise to get rid of the data structure that I try to implement for represeing the program,
    and work directly with the tree structures.

    I try to understand them. But the more I look ak them, the more chaotic they look.
    And documentation is really bad.
    I would really think this is some ancient, abandoned project, if the word "gcc" was not in written my url bar...
    Terrible.

    I have unit-tested the lexxer. Works fine. A few todos left.
    I try to setup the parser. At the same time. The application-core is under construction, on its first stages.
    The project is still on its early stages.
