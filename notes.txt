/////////////////
FLEX/BISON NOTES
////////////////

    Locations: a location has 2 positions: begin and end.
    Those indicate where the token starter, and where it ended.

    The strategy that we follow is that we set the start and end to equal values before every yylex call.
    When we match a rule, we progress the end value, leaving the begin intact.

    - YY_USER_ACTION Executed each time a rule matches, after yytext and yyleng were set, but before the action is triggered.
    - location.step() changes the begin to be equal to the end. It does not affect the end.

EUL NOTES
/////////
Every type can have its own:
  definition of ==
  definition of []
  definition of toBoolean
  definition of toString

  constructor by literal assignment (array literal, number literal etc)



llvm will produce an ir asm file
then, use llc testOut to create a .s assembly file
