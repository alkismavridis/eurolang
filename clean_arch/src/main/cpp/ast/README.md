- The deepest layer. Depends on no other.

- NO text-specifics go in here (grammar, syntax etc).
  This packaged knows nothing about how an actual eul source file looks like.
  It only knows the structured data that should come out of it.

- NO error logging in here. As less error throwing as possible.
  The analyser should deal with the errors.
